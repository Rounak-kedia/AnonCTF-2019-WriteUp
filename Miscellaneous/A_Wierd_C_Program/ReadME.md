**Problem Statement:**

>Tom and Jerry are friends and like to give each other challenging task from time to time. Tom was taking classes for learning C programming language,as he became pro,he decided to challenge Jerry.But instead of giving the executable, Tom gives him the actual code of the C program and tells Jerry to find the flag. Now Jerry wonders what could be the new twist this time?

## Write-Up

When you look at the given C program, you will find something weird with it's formatting and indentation.
Actually it's not a C program but a white-space program.Use any online interpreter to execute the file.
Doing this gives you the output `the_flag_is_WpUAItsadmhak`

Append this to the flag format and you get your flag.

The Flag is `anonCTF{the_flag_is_WpUAItsadmhak}`
